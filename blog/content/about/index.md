## Hey There!
I'm a computer scientist with a background and interest in algorithm analysis and functional programming. In my free time, I contribute to open source projects in Python, Haskell, and Go. This blog is a tool built to communicate the interesting things I encounter in my studies and research to anyone who has the time (and patience) to listen.

If you'd like to see how this website was made, you can find the source code for it [here](https://github.com/Seancarpenter/blog).

**New posts are published on the first day of each month.**
