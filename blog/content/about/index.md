## Hey There!
Thanks for dropping by. I'm a software engineer with a background in data engineering and an interest in traditional computer science algorithms. My day job is primarily building and maintaining data pipelines in AWS. In my free time, I create and contribute to open source projects in Python, Haskell and Go on a variety of different topics.
