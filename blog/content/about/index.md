## Hey There!
I'm a software engineer with a background in data engineering and an interest in traditional computer science algorithms. In my free time, I create and contribute to open source projects in Python, Haskell and Go. This blog contains most of the interesting things I've encountered in my studies and research. New posts come out on the first of each month.
