## Hey There!
I'm a software engineer with a background in data engineering and an interest in traditional computer science algorithms. In my free time, I create and contribute to open source projects in Python, Haskell and Go. This blog contains most of the interesting things I've encountered in my studies and research.  If you'd like to see how this website was made, you can find the source code for it [here](https://github.com/Seancarpenter/blog).

**New posts come out on the first day of each month.**
