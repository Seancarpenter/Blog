## Hey There!
Thanks for dropping by. I'm a software engineer with a background in Data Engineering and an interest in traditional computer science algorithms and functional programming. My day job is primarily building and maintaining data pipelines in AWS. In my free time, I create and contribute to open source projects in Python, Haskell and Go in a variety of different topics.
