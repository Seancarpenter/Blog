# Hey There!
I'm a professional programmer with a background in a variety of different software engineering and computer science topics. In my spare time, I write [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) software and talk about it on the internet.

### About The Blog
Opinionator is an educational blog comprised mostly of the following topics:

- Algorithm Analysis and Development
- Information Theory
- Functional Programming
- Concurrent and Distributed Systems
- Computer Architecture

All content on Opinionator is provided **free of charge** and is **not monetized** in any way. You will not find any ads on Opinionator, nor will Opinionator track you or remember anything about you between visits. All links to external resources are **unaffiliated** and do not benefit me in any way. As a result, if a link on my website redirects you to a paid product (such as a textbook) it is because I am of the opinion that it is worth purchasing, and almost certainly own a copy myself.

If you'd like to see how Opinionator was built, you can find the source code for it [here](https://github.com/Seancarpenter/blog).

**New posts are published on the first day of each month.**
