Thanks for dropping by! There's nothing here yet, but there will be soon. If you'd like to see how this website was made, you can find the source code for it [here](https://github.com/Seancarpenter/blog). The first post will be on the introduction to concurrency to Go that I presented at Devfest DC this last summer. If you'd like a sneak peak, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Seancarpenter/a-pragmatic-introduction-to-concurrency-in-go). Till next time!
