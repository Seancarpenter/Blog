Go (or Golang) is a relatively new language developed at Google that's garnered a lot of attention in the last few years for its simplicity, speed, and concurrency features. In a rather short amount of time, a slew of extremely popular and performant applications have been built using Go. To name a few:

- [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform): A configuration language and engine used to generate and manage cloud infrastructure.
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/hashicorp/kubernetes): A distributed server framework used to manage multiple containerized applications.
- [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo): A static site generator that uses a sort of markdown+ syntax to generate HTML. This website was built using Hugo!
