### Overview

Source code for my personal blog, hosted at http://www.seancarpenter.io

To fetch the this repo and associated submodules (such as the zzo theme), call:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Seancarpenter/Blog

The static CSS and HTML are generated using Hugo https://gohugo.io/ and a slightly modified version of the Zzo theme https://github.com/zzossig/hugo-theme-zzo. As the Zzo theme being used for this website has been modified a bit, it's not synced up with the actual theme hosted on Github, and will gradually drift as changes to Hugo and Zzo are made.

This project was built using Hugo Version 0.62
